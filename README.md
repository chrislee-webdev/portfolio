# portfolio

##This is the portfolio project for the Week 2 challenege. 

###This challenege tasked me with building a portfolio website that is
required to meet the following criteria:
Include developer name, photo and contact links
Working nav links
Images of developer projects of which the first project has to have a larger 
image than the others
Images work as links top deployed projects (only the firt project has a working link as the others are placeholders)
A responsive layout (breakpoint at 320px and 768px)
